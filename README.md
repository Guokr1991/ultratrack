Ultrasonic Tracking Simulation Tools
====================================
[Field II](http://field-ii.dk) ultrasonic displacement tracking code using FEM
displacement fields.  The 3D nodal displacement data from the FEM sims are used
to translate a volume of acoustic scattereres, and synthetic RF data is
generated for each time step using the transducer parameters defined in
[driver.m](driver.m).

Installation
============
 * Add the ultratrack repository your Matlab path.  One approach is to add the
   following to ```$HOME/matlab/startup.m```:

   ```
   addpath('PATH/TO/GIT/CLONED/ultratrack');
   ```

 * There is a ```probes``` submodule available to restricted institutions.  If
   you do not have access to that repository, then you can use
   [probe_linear.m](probe_linear.m) as starting points to define transducers.  
   
   If you do have access, then you can initialize the submodule using:
   
   + ```git submodule init``` 
   + ```git submodule update```

Usage
=====
[ultra_driver.m](ultra_driver.m) is an example driver script for 1:1 scanning
with a linear array.
